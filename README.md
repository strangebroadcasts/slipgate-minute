# slipgate-minute
The New York Minute comes to Quake 1. Originally for 7DFPS 2018.

Compile with [FTEQCC](http://fte.triptohell.info/) or similar.

## License
This mod is built on top of and includes files from QuakeC 1.06, which lacks a GPL notice, unlike QC 1.01.
As such, the license situation is not completely clear - until I have time to rebuild the mod on top of a
proper GPL fork, however, you may use any code *added* by the mod under the GPLv2 license.
